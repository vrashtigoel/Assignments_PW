        "2.\tSyntax requirement: In Python, indentation is not just for readability; it's also syntactically required. The interpreter uses indentation to determine the grouping of statements. If you don't follow the correct indentation rules, Python will throw an error, such as IndentationError.\n"

Even small mistakes, like mixing spaces and tabs, can cause problems.\n",
